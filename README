git.gitignore

This is a boiler plate .gitignore file that I use in my projects that use the Git VCS. It ignores the folders I use in my typical folder tree; complied source files; archive and packages; log files and system files.

Some of this is taken from the Github help article on ignore files (http://help.github.com/ignore-files/).

You may not see the actual .gitignore file as it is a system file, but it is there! You'll see it if you do a "git ls-files" in the working directory.
